description: "<p><b>Research project:</b><br>'Chaos' is a communication primitive for cyber-physical systems - anything that combines sensors, actuators and processors (e.g. cars, drones, smart cities) - that currently works with only one specific system and radio type. <br> </p> 
<p><b>Main responsibilities:</b><br> I did a <b> feasibility study</b> to determine whether it could also work on the<b> Bluetooth Low Energy </b> physical layer and demonstrated this with an implementation on the <b> ARM based Nordic Semiconductor NRF51 chip</b>.<br> This involved adapting the CHAOS algorithm to the specifics of the BLE Phy in order to improve the performance. I also build a 25 node testbed to automate the <b> testing </b> using a combination of bash and Python scripting. </p> <br> <p>The project took place at Chalmers University of Technology (Gothenburg, Sweden) and at the TU Delft. </p>"
